 <h3 class="t">4.What are Assets and Liabilities:</h3>
  <p class="e">The items that you own and can generate future income are your assets and the things which you owe to others are your liabilities. For example, if you save and then invest in a fixed deposit, it is your asset. On the other hand, if you have an outstanding loan, say to a bank or any individual, it is your liabilities.</p>
 <h3 class="t">5. What is Debt:</h3>
 <p class="e">Money borrowed for covering the shortage money when expenses are more than the income.</p>
  <h3 class="t">6. Time Value of Money</h3>
 <div class="e"><img src="images/pp.jpg" width="1100" height="300" alt="content"></div> 
 <p class="e"> As time passes you will realize that if 10 years back you could afford to purchase a full lunch for 10rupess, today you could afford to get only a few pieces of vegetables. This means that the value of a five hundred rupee note would be higher today than after five years.  Although the note in the same,  you can do much more with the money if you have it now because over time you can make money grow ny earning interest on yhe money.  By receiving 500rupess today,  you can increase the future amount of your money by investing and gaining interest or capital apprecaiation over a period of time.</p>
 <br>
 <p class="e">At the most basic level, the time value of money demonstrates thar time literally is money - the value of the money you have now is not the same  as it will be in the fature and vice versa.</p>

   <h3 class="t">7. What is Inflation and its effects on Investments:</h3>
  <table  width="90%"class="e">
  <tr>
  <td class="e">Inflation bacsically refers to rise in prices of goods and services. Over time, as the cost of goods and services increases, the ability of a unit of money, say one rupee or rupes 100, to buy goods and services keeps declining. in other words, the 'ourchasing power' of money decreases.It is important to take into account the effects of inflation on your investments during finacial planning.  investors greatly fear inflation  since it reduces the value of their investment.</td><td><img src="images/pig.jpg" width="500" height="250"></td>

 <h3 class="t">What are the steps that an investor can take to avoid the adverse effects of inflation?</h3>
  <p class="e">Try to determine your "real rate of return", or the return you can expect after factoring in the effects of inflation. tTo mitigate the decrease in the time value of money, you can invest the money available to you today at a rate equal or higher than the rate of inflation.</p>
   <h3 class="t">8. What is Power of Compounding:</h3>
 <p class="e">With simple interest, you earn interest only on the principal(that is, the amount you initially invested); while with compounding, you earn interest on the principal as well as on the interest on the interest previously earned on the principal amount.<br><br>Lets understand the magic of compounding with the help of an example.</p>

 <td width="55%" style="text-align:left">Mathematicians say that you can find out how long it will take you to double your money simply by dividing 72 by the interest rate. so let's say your parent give you Rupes 200 for your birthday and you plan to invest it. If you put the money into an account that earns 6 percent interest a year, how long will it take to grow to Rupes 400?<div class="e" style="color:black;background-color:white">So in 12 years, your money will have doubled to Rupess 400.</div></td>
